Next Session - CD Pipeline Goals:

ðŸŽ¯ Extend your clean GitHub Actions workflow to include deployment
ðŸŽ¯ Add proper deployment steps to push from ACR â†’ Container Apps
ðŸŽ¯ Full control over the entire CI/CD process in one place
ðŸŽ¯ No more Azure shortcuts or auto-generated garbage
ðŸŽ¯ Proper staging/production workflow if needed

What We'll Build:
Your docker-push-acr.yml workflow will become a complete CI/CD pipeline:

Build & Test (CI)
Push to ACR (CI)
Deploy to Container Apps (CD)
Optional: Health checks, rollback, notifications

Benefits:

âœ… Single workflow file you control completely
âœ… Visible deployment history in GitHub Actions
âœ… Easy rollbacks and debugging
âœ… No Azure portal dependencies

You've got a solid foundation now with the working Container App. Adding the CD piece will give you a bulletproof, professional deployment pipeline that you can demo to customers with confidence.
