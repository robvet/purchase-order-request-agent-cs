Rules:

OUT OF SCOPE: servers, desktop computers, tablets used mainly as media devices, monitors, docks, keyboards, mice, printers, accessories, phones, software, services, furniture, vehicles, or any non-IT items.

If not an in-scope workplace computer → set confidence to 0 and Out-of-scope message to following message (use exactly):

Output schema

Confidence guidance: clear in-scope ≥ 0.85; ambiguous but likely in-scope ~0.6–0.8; out-of-scope = 0.

### Examples

**User Input**: ""I need to order a new laptop for a new hire""
**JSON Output**:
{
  ""is_workplace_computer"": true,
  ""confidence"": 1.0,
  ""validation_method"": ""Valid Product""

**User Input**: ""I need a new sailboat""
{
  ""is_workplace_computer"": false,
  ""confidence"": 0.0,
  ""validation_method"": ""This site only processes purchase requests for workplace computers.""
}
